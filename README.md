# NLP-Learning

## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey into Natural Language Processing (NLP), a key AI subfield focusing on computer-human language interaction. As I progress through my NLP course, I'm using this space to catalog concepts, code snippets, and insights. It serves as my personal learning log and reference guide for NLP techniques in text analysis and generation.

## Introduction to NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in useful ways.

## Key Concepts

(This section will be updated as I progress through my course)

- Stemming and Lemmatization

## Code Snippets

(Example code snippets will be added here as I learn and implement NLP techniques)

```python
// WIP
```

## Resources

- Course materials (to be added)
- Recommended readings
- Useful libraries and tools
